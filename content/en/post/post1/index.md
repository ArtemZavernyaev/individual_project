## Finished reading some book

I have finally finished a book written by Victor Mary-Hugo "The Ninty third year". A very dramatic and tough novel, if you ask me. Anyway, the plot was good and exciting as always when we speakabout Hugo works!

## General summary of the week 

The week was not really hard, but it was calm and spread. There were some tough days, but they will be forgotten soon, so no point in remembering bad things at all.
